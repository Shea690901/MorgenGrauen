DESCRIPTION
      This command is used to set some tool-specific behaviours.
      - "update" clones a new Xtool and destructs the old one. This should
        only be done when working on the source of the tool and to get a fast
        update. Settings and aliases will be reached through the new clone.
      - "heart=<on|off>" turns the heart beat of the tool on or off.
        The heart beat is for a higher security and to keep the other checks
        running. If you just want to use the Xtool as a passive tool without
        any checks then turn the heart beat off.
      - "first=<on|off>" turns the automatic moving into the pole position
        of your inventory on or off. Turning it off, avoids struggle with
        other tools which behave same, but also reduces security. The history
        mechanism will also capture the less commands.
      - "protect=<on|off>" turns on/off the protection mode of the Xtool.
        It will protect you from forces of other wizards and of player objects
        which try to move into your inventory.
      - "invcheck=<on|off>" turns the automatic check of your inventory on or
        off. If turned on, all new objects in your inventory will be reported.
      - "envcheck=<on|off>" like "invcheck" but checks your environment, the
        content of the current room.
      - "ndcheck=<on|off>" sets the netdeadchecking mode of the Xtool.
      - "short=<on|off>" turns displaying of short descriptions on or off.
        This is to avoid to get on other wizards nerves, when they have a tool
        that notifies inventory checks (like this tool does :). But the main
        reason is to cope with bad short descriptions of objects. For
        example if you want to destruct it a bug in the short desc. would
        make it nearly impossible to do so.
      - "more=<amount>" sets the amount of lines that will be displayed at one
        time with the xmore command. Will be removed soon because there is a
        player property called P_PAGESIZE to take care of it.
      - "echo=<on|off>" turns the echoing of commands executed via alias,
        history or multiple command execution on or off.
      - "kill" destructs the Xtool and removes it from the autoload list.
      - "news" show the news and changes of the Xtool.
      - "save" saves the settings of the Xtool including the aliases into a
        file.
      - "load" restores the saved settings from the save file.
      - "reset" resets the Xtool.
