SYNOPSIS
      xcallouts [search pattern]
	  or
	  xcallouts    (when writing to a pipe)

DESCRIPTION
      With no argument it shows all your callouts. With a regexp as argument,
      all matching callouts will be printed. When writing to a pipe, all
	  call_outs will be printed and the search pattern is not allowed.

EXAMPLES
      xcallouts obj   Show all callouts with the string "obj" in it.
      xcallouts .     Show all callouts. Please never do this if it isn't
                      really neccessary. It just costs time - and what do you
                      want to do with this mass of information?
