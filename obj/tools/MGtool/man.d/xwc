SYNOPSIS
      xwc [-clw] <file>
	  or
	  xwc [-clw]    (when reading from a pipe)

DESCRIPTION
      xwc counts the number of bytes, whitespace-separated words, and new-
      lines in a given file, or reading from a pipe. It prints one line
      of counts, and if the file name was given as an argument, it prints
      the filename following the counts. The counts are printed in the
      order: lines, words, bytes.
      By default, wc prints all three counts.

OPTIONS:
      -c print character count

      -l print line count

      -w print word count
