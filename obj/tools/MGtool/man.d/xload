SYNOPSIS
      xload <filename>

DESCRIPTION
      Update and load the object specified by the filename. If you update
      your current environment, all players will be moved silently into
      "/std/void" and after successful updating and loading back into it.

EXAMPLES
      xload $here
      Update and reload the current room (but without a trip into the void :).

      xload obj/little_thing.c
      Update and load it.
