SYNOPSIS
      xinherit <object> [function]

DESCRIPTION
      Show the inheritance tree of an object and if optional specified
      display all occurencies of the function.
      The inheritance tree is perhaps not the one you expect to see. In
      fact its the one the gamedriver really uses. That means if for
      example two object inherit each other or in any other case of recursion
      it will not be shown. Or if an object A inherits object B and C
      and object B also inherits object C, the object C will only displayed
      once (because the gamedriver also inherits object once).

EXAMPLE
      xinherit $me
