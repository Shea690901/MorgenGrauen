SYNOPSIS
      xuclone <filename>

DESCRIPTION
      Updates & Clones an object. On error, the error log file will be
      printed. Moves the object (if possible) into your inventory. If the
      object has been cloned successfully, the variable "$clone" will be set,
      to make sure we don't lose the object out of sight :)

EXAMPLE
      xuclone /std/thing
      xcall $clone->SetShort("a BIG thing!");
