SYNOPSIS
      xgoto [object]

DESCRIPTION
      Go inside <object>. Without an argument you will leave into your
      workroom. If <object> is a living thing, goto it's environment
      (never tested until now, when going to a living thing, inside
      a living thing :)

EXAMPLES
      xgoto /room/shop
      xgoto shop	 (both are the same, because if there is no shop in
			  the current directory, a "/room/" will be appended
			  to the argument)
      xgoto public enemy (do this only when you are really bored)
