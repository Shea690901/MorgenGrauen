SYNOPSIS
      xcall <object>-><function>(<expression>)

DESCRIPTION
      Calls the lfun <function> of the <object> with <expression> as
      argument. The <properties.h> are included. Three objects are allready
      defined on invokation. "me" represents the onwer of the Xtool. "here"
      is the current room and "obj" is the object which lfun is called.
      To use the object access syntax described above, a function called
      "get(string)" can be used. If the call returned an object, the variable
      "$result" will be set to this object.
      xcall includes a private ~/.xtool.h, if it exists, to support user
      defined macros.

EXAMPLES
      xcall $me->QueryProp(P_LONG)
      xcall /std/thing#145->SetProp(P_SHORT,"a small thing")
      xcall /secure/master->add_domain_wiz("hell", "hyp")
      xcall $me->move(get("^deepthought"),"go")
      (the last one uses the function get() to find the room where our god is)
