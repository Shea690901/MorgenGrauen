SYNOPSIS
      xproc [-c] [-l] [-m] [-u] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
      xproc prints information from the /proc filesystem to the screen.
      The format is totally unformatted! (I can't help it for now...) 
      Without any option, it display the machines load averages.

      -c: cpu information
      -l: load averages
      -m: memory usage
      -u: machine's uptime
      -v: kernel version
