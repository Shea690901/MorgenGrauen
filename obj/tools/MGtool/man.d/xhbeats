SYNOPSIS
      xhbeats [search pattern]
      or
	  xhbeats     (when writing to a pipe)

DESCRIPTION
      With no argument it shows all your objects which have a running heart
      beat. With a regexp as argument, all matching objects will be printed.
	  When writing to a pipe, all hearbeats will be printed and a search
	  pattern is not allowed.

EXAMPLES
      xhbeats obj   Show all objects which have a running heart beat at the
                    object names with the string "obj" in it.
      xhbeats .     Show all callouts. Please don't do this if it isn't
                    really neccessary. It just costs time - and what do you
                    want to do with this information?
