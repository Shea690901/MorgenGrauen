SYNOPSIS
      xmtp [options] <directory> <file>

DESCRIPTION
      Create a script file for transfering complete directories with mtp.
      If your mtp needs extra arguments (except of the -r option which
      stands for reading files) for example the -g option then you can add
      then to the command.
      This command works recursively and can cause a to deep recursion or
      a too long evaluation error when trying to make a script for huge
      directories like "/players" for example.
      If the <file> allready exists it will not be removed instead the script
      will simply added to the end of the file.

EXAMPLE
      xmtp -gtubmud /basic ~/basic.csh
      Create a script file "basic.csh" to transfer the whole content of the
      "/basic" directory.

      On your host you then just create a directory (normally with the same
      name give to the xmtp command), change into the directory and read
      the script file with "mtp -r basic.csh". Then just execute the script
      with "csh" or "sh".
