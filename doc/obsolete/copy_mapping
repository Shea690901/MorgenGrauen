SYNOPSIS:
	mapping copy_mapping(mapping)

DESCRIPTION:
        Create a shallow copy of <arg> and return it. For arrays and mappings
        this means that a new array or mapping is created with copies of the
        original content. Embedded arrays and mappings are copied by reference!

EXAMPLE
        mixed *a, *b;

        a = ({ 1, ({ 21, 22 }) });
        b = copy(a);
        a[0] = -1; a[1][0] = -21;
         --> a is now ({ -1, ({ -21, 22 }) })
             b is now ({  1, ({ -21, 22 }) })

WARNING
	Keep in mind, that a copy of a mapping, that contains arrays/mappings,
	contains references to these Mappings/Arrays, not real copies. If you
	don't take care, you can a) change the original mappings while working
	on the copy and b) create recursive mappings, that leak memory.

HISTORY
  Superseeded by the copy() efun.
  Removed in LDMud 3.3 and LP "03.02.1@150".
