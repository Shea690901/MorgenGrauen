SYNOPSIS:
        void move_object(mixed item, mixed dest)

        item->move(object dest, string methods)

DESCRIPTION:
	The item, which can be a object_name or an object, is moved into
	it's new environment dest, which can also be object_name or an
	object.  In native mode, the only object that can be moved
	with move_object() is the calling object itself. This function
	is only used to implement the lfun move().
        
        Use the lfun move() instead by inheriting standard objects.
	move() must be called in the object to be moved. This gives
	the moved object full control over its movement.
