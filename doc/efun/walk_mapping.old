        void walk_mapping(mapping m, string func, mixed extra,...)
        void walk_mapping(mapping m, string func, string|object ob
                                                , mixed extra,...)

        Calls ob->func(key, value1, ..., valueN, extra,...) resp. applies
        the closure to every entry in the mapping. The keys are passed
