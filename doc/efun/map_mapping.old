SYNOPSIS:
	mapping map_indices(mapping m, string func, object ob, ...)
	mapping map_indices(mapping m, closure cl, ...)

DESCRIPTION:
	ob->func() is called resp. cl applied to every element in the
	mapping, with first argument the first data item of the
	element, and then the extra args that were given to
	map_indices. The data item in the mapping is replaced by the
	return value of the function. ob can also be a object_name of an
	object. If the second arg is a string and the third is not an
	object, this_object() will be used as default.

	map(E), walk_mapping(E), member(E), m_contains(E)
