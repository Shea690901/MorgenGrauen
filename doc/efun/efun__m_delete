SYNOPSIS:
	mapping m_delete(mapping map, mixed key)

DESCRIPTION:
	Remove the entry with index 'key' from mapping 'map', and
	return the changed mapping. If the mapping does not have an
	entry with index 'key', the first argument is returned.

        If you don't want to modify the mapping map, checkout the
        simul_efun m_delete().

EXAMPLE: 

        mapping m1, m2;

        m1 = ([ "a":1, "b":2, "c":3 ]);

        m2 = efun::m_delete(m1, "b");
           => m1 = ([ "a":1, "c":3 ])
	      m2 = ([ "a":1, "c":3 ])
