NAME
        debugmalloc

DESCRIPTION
        This command is hardcoded into the driver.

        Toggles the debug mode for the memory managment.
        If the O_IS_WIZARD flag is used in the mudlib (i.e. if
        set_is_wizard() was called), this command is allowed only for
        users that have this flag set.

HISTORY
        Deactivated in 3.2.7 by default, it was effectless before anyway.

SEE ALSO
        malloc(D), status(D), memory(C), objects(C), debug_info(E),
        set_is_wizard(E)
