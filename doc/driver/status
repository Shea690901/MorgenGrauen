NAME
        status
        status tables
        status swap
        status malloc

DESCRIPTION
        This command is hardcoded into the drivers input routine.
        It displays information about the run status of the system.
        If the O_IS_WIZARD flag is used in the mudlib (i.e. if
        set_is_wizard() was called), this command is allowed only for
        users that have this flag set.

HISTORY
        3.2.7 added the 'status malloc' variant.

SEE ALSO
        malloc(D), memory(C), objects(C), debug_info(E), set_is_wizard(E)
