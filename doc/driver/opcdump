NAME
        opcdump

DESCRIPTION
        If the driver was compiled to do opcode profiling, this command
        will save the collected profiling information into the file /OPC_DUMP.
        If the O_IS_WIZARD flag is used in the mudlib (i.e. if
        set_is_wizard() was called), this command is allowed only for
        users that have this flag set.

SEE ALSO
        malloc(D), status(D), memory(C), objects(C), debug_info(E),
        set_is_wizard(E)
